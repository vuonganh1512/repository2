Plagiarism Detector
==

This assigned is based on [this "nifty" assignment](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2008/franke-catch-plagiarists/)

Code
===
The code is [on github here](https://github.com/jspacco/cs220-plagiarism-detector). Fork the repo!

There is an API (basically, an interface) for you to implement called `IPlagiarismDetector`. Your code goes in `PlagiarismDetector`.

Documents
===
There are 1,800 documents, ranging from a few dozen words to over 1,000 words, with about 418 words the average length of a document.

Some notes on the data format:
* The documents are split into sentences, with one sentence per line.
* Treat punctuation as a separate word. This is a common approach when processing text.
* Process the sentences one at a time. This means that n-grams should not "span" a line. So once you get to the end of a line of text, stop processing, read the next line, and start again.
    * An easy way to do this is with a `Scanner` and a while loop using the `hasNextLine()` and `nextLine()` methods.
    * Convert each line you've read with the `Scanner` into `String[]` like this: `line.split(" ")` and then you can write for loops to go through the array.
* If any line has fewer words than the number of n-grams (so a sentence with 2 words when N is 3), just skip it. Real data is messy and we have to make decisions like this all the time; it will be fine.
* The data files are taken from a Kaggle contest, which is why they are restricted to only Knox students, as I'm not supposed to publicly redistribute them.

The documents for testing are NOT stored in the Github repo. This is because it is not a good practice to store lots of data on Github. Instead, find the documents on [Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10AM2DyjpUpodCfFYzxNS5NIqx1D95eGB/view?usp=sharing).

Download the zipfile, and then extract or unzip it into your Eclipse project. It should look like this:

Your Eclipse folder structure **`must look exactly like this`**. If you have an extra folder, so it's "docs/docs/tinydocs" instead of "docs/tinydocs", then you have to fix it by moving folders around. (This often happens when extracting on Windows.) If your extracted/unzipped documents are not in your Eclipse folder, none of the test cases will be able to find them.



What to submit
===
* A link to your Github repo
* A Google Doc that answers the following questions:
    * Which documents, if any, seem like they were plagiarized?
    * What values of N did you try, and what effects did you observe from these different values?
    * What was a good threshold for number of n-grams in common for two documents to seem suspicious?
        * Remember, the documents vary in length, so having a certain number of n-grams in common does not automatically mean there was plagiarism! It just means the documents seem suspicious and require a human to look at them.
    * What kind of runtimes are you looking at to process all 1800 documents? It takes about a minute on my machine.
